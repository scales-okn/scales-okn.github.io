In situations where we&#39;ve needed a glimpse into complaint documents, the &#39;raw_info&#39; field in SCALES parties&#39; &#39;entity_info&#39; dictionaries, which is derived from the italicized subheadings attached to PACER party names, has proven helpful given that it often reproduces the self-descriptions provided by litigants in their initial filings. And for studies like the qualified immunity example above, SCALES&#39;s ongoing docket ontology project — in which we&#39;re training transformer models to predict which docket entries in a case correspond to which phases of that case&#39;s lifetime (opening, early dismissal, settlement, judgment...) — may provide a way to zero in on a few documents of interest per case, thereby drastically reducing the overhead associated with mining data from documents. In all of these instances, PACER&#39;s perennial unpredictability, so often a hindrance to effective research, provides an unexpected boon in the form of valuable data hidden in the nooks and crannies of docket sheets.</p><h2 id="epilogue-the-pacer-fee-puzzle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue-the-pacer-fee-puzzle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue: The PACER Fee Puzzle</h2>',8),B={href:"https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/free-pacer-bill-end-fees-online-court-records-advances-senate-2021-12-09/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Y={href:"https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},$={href:"https://free.law/recap",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},X={href:"http://livingreports.scales-okn.org",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Q=e("p",null,[t("Fortunately, if you decide to use PACER downloads for your research, you may be able to trim costs by way of intelligent downloading practice.

How should you go about locating this footprint? You could choose a sensible search term such as "in forma pauperis" and identify all cases whose SCALES 'docket' field contains a match, but given the multitude of district- and clerk-specific docketing conventions, this strategy runs the risk of being both too broad (flagging red herrings like "no motion to proceed in forma pauperis was received") and too narrow (missing outliers like "motion to proceed without prepayment of fees"). Thus, a more fruitful strategy might involve manually reviewing all fee-waiver-related language that appears in the dataset, and then writing some `),e("a",N,[t("regular expressions"),a(o)]),t(" to encapsulate the full range of that language when searching docket entries for fee waiver activity.

(As any attorney working in federal court knows well,) PACER is not only a data storage system but also a tool for managing litigation in progress. In other words, users can consult PACER to learn about cases from years past, or they can use the platform to file motions, upload documents, and keep abreast of other parties' actions in the midst of ongoing case proceedings.
