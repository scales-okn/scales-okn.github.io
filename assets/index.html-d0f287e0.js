However, as we've built a parsing pipeline to convert docket sheets from raw HTML into database-ready JSON objects, we've found that the PACER platform โ while indeed showing enormous promise as a driver of large-scale legal research โ also suffers from a host of shortfalls, quirks, and inconsistencies.`,-1),E=e("p",null,"In this guide, we'll describe some of these peculiarities and offer suggestions for working around them, whether you're using our already-parsed case data corpus or running our parser on docket sheets of your own.

A few examples: In some of our work with criminal convictions, statute citations that we assumed to be locked away in charging documents were actually accessible via &quot;case summaries,&quot; a little-known PACER feature described in more detail in the <a href="../../scraper">scraper documentation</a>. In situations where we&#39;ve needed a glimpse into complaint documents, the &#39;raw_info&#39; field in SCALES parties&#39; &#39;entity_info&#39; dictionaries, which is derived from the italicized subheadings attached to PACER party names, has proven helpful given that it often reproduces the self-descriptions provided by litigants in their initial filings. And for studies like the qualified immunity example above, SCALES&#39;s ongoing docket ontology project โ in which we&#39;re training transformer models to predict which docket entries in a case correspond to which phases of that case&#39;s lifetime (opening, early dismissal, settlement, judgment...) โ may provide a way to zero in on a few documents of interest per case, thereby drastically reducing the overhead associated with mining data from documents. In all of these instances, PACER&#39;s perennial unpredictability, so often a hindrance to effective research, provides an unexpected boon in the form of valuable data hidden in the nooks and crannies of docket sheets.</p><h2 id="epilogue-the-pacer-fee-puzzle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#epilogue-the-pacer-fee-puzzle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Epilogue: The PACER Fee Puzzle</h2>',8),B={href:"https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/free-pacer-bill-end-fees-online-court-records-advances-senate-2021-12-09/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Y={href:"https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},$={href:"https://free.law/recap",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},X={href:"http://livingreports.scales-okn.org",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Q=e("p",null,[t("Fortunately, if you decide to use PACER downloads for your research, you may be able to trim costs by way of intelligent downloading practice.

(As any attorney working in federal court knows well,) PACER is not only a data storage system but also a tool for managing litigation in progress. In other words, users can consult PACER to learn about cases from years past, or they can use the platform to file motions, upload documents, and keep abreast of other parties' actions in the midst of ongoing case proceedings.
