This is a compendium of various resources that we think might be valuable to our users, collaborators, and the general public. In the <a href="scraper">Documentation</a> section, you can access traditional documentation-style outlines of our code, including our PACER scraper and parser. In the <a href="guide/parserguide">Guides</a> section, you&#39;ll find more casual material that we&#39;ve written on the ins and outs of our software tools and research work. These guides are an effort to share important insights that don&#39;t quite fit into the low-level technical focus of the documentation pages, but that we believe will enrich your experience with the SCALES-OKN platform.</p><p>As we expand our research work and make more of our results available to the public, we&#39;ll be updating this site with additional guides and links, so make sure to check back regularly to see what we&#39;re up to. And if you have any specific questions or requests, feel free to reach out directly; we&#39;re a small, responsive team that&#39;s always looking for new collaborations and partnerships, so we&#39;d love to hear from you! You can find our contact information <a href="contact">here</a>.</p><p><em>Note that this site does not host the SCALES codebase. To view and download our code, you can visit our Github repositories, which are listed <a href="repos">here</a>.</em></p>',4),r=[i];function n(c,h){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const l=e(s,[["render",n],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
